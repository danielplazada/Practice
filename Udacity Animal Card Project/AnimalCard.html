			<p>Rabbits are small, furry mammals with long ears,<br>
				short fluffy tails, and strong, large hind legs. <br>
				They have 2 pairs of sharp incisors (front teeth), <br>
				one pair on top and one pair on the bottom. ...<br>
				Their teeth are specifically adapted for gnawing <br>
				and grow continuously throughout their lives.

			<p>Happy rabbits practice a cute behavior known as a<br>
			 “binky:” they jump up in the air and twist and spin<br>
			 around! A baby rabbit is called a kit, a female is<br>
			 called a doe, and a male is a buck. A group of rabbits<br>
			 is called a herd. Rabbits are herbivores, eating a diet<br>
			 entirely of grasses and other plants.
